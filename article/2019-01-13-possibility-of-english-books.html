Possibility of writing English C++ textbooks
</a></h1>

<p>
I Ryou Ezoe. I made my living by explaining the very latest C++ features in Japanese. I wrote two C++ books. 
</p>

<p>
"C++11 core languages" which explains all the details of C++11 core: <a href="https://github.com/EzoeRyou/cpp-book">https://github.com/EzoeRyou/cpp-book</a>
</p>

<p>
"Ryou Ezoe's detail explanation of C++17" which explains all the new C++17 features: <a href="https://github.com/EzoeRyou/cpp17book">https://github.com/EzoeRyou/cpp17book</a> 
</p>

<p>
My books use strong copyleft licence because I'm a believer of the free software. A concept defined by RMS. My last C++17 book was GPLv3 because I convinced the publisher and editor to release the source code of the book under the GPLv3 license. The github repository contains the markdown source file I wrote and the very same tex source code the publisher used to layout and print my book.
</p>

<p>
I'm writing in Japanese because it's the native language for me. I've never thought writing in English because: 1) English is not my native languages so my English is not great. 2) there are so many talanted native English speakers so I have no hope of competing with them.
</p>

<p>
I made my living from niche demand that Japanese explanation of the latest C++ features are lacking and not much competition going on.
</p>

<p>
Then, I realised that there are regular reader of my blog articles and books through ... machine translation!
</p>

<p>
This fact surprise me. grammatically, Japanese and English are way too much different so the machine translation between Japanese and English doesn't work well.
</p>

<p>
But if the situation in English publishing is so severe to the point that some people relies on machine translation to read my Japanese books, I suspect that there isn't much competition going on in English publishing, which may make me a competent writer in the market.
</p>

<p>
So I wrote an short English article for the overview of C++20 Range view.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://ezoeryou.github.io/blog/article/2019-01-10-range-view.html">The overview of C++20 Range view</a>
</p>

<p>
It turns out writing English isn't that hard. There are minor grammatical errors here and there. But these errrors can be fixed by proofreading of natives. As for the writing speed, I spend more time on studying the new knowledge than actually writing the explanation, so English doesn't slow down the writing speed. For that, I think I can manage to write both Japanese and English in parallel for my next C++20 book.
